## Project Structure

Each project includes:
- `README.md` - Project description and requirements
- `src/` - Source code files
- `include/` - Header files
- `tests/` - Test files
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `Makefile` - Build configuration

## Development Guidelines

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Read requirements carefully
   - Design your solution
   - Break down into smaller tasks

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow C coding standards
   - Add comprehensive comments

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Test all functionality
   - Handle edge cases
   - Verify memory management

4. **Documentation Phase**
   - Document your design decisions
   - Explain complex algorithms
   - Provide usage examples

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality** (40%) - Does it work correctly?
- **Code Quality** (30%) - Is it well-written and maintainable?
- **Performance** (20%) - Is it efficient?
- **Documentation** (10%) - Is it well-documented?
